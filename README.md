# Bamazon-CLI

**Welsom to the "bamazonCustomer" CLI App!!**

In this app I've created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, Inquirer accessed through Node.js.  The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, I have programed the app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
